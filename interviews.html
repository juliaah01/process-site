						<h4>Glenda Skipper</h4>
						<p>Founder of One Child at a Time</p>

						<h4> In your words, what is the purpose of One Child at a Time?</h4>
						<p> Our mission is to eliminate modern slavery one person at a time. We work to prevent human trafficking through education, rescue trafficking individuals through intervention, and restore human dignity through affirmation.</p>
						<h4> Why did you begin One Child at a Time?</h4>
						<p> In 2017, I went on a mission trip to India and saw firsthand the effects of human trafficking. I was devastated to see the destruction it was causing and I desperately just wanted to help one child at least. God put the phrase "one child at a time" on my heart and I began the organization shortly after returning from the trip.</p>
						<h4> What is a short term goal of One Child at a Time?</h4>
						<p> Educate locally in all school districts. </p>
						<h4> What is a long term goal for One Child at a Time? </h4>
						<p> Providing a physical safe place victims can go to experience the affirmation we can offer. </p>
						<h4> What is a goal for your website?</h4>
						<p> We need to scale back on all of our information and prioritize education. The homepage especially needs to be prioritized to show what is happening currently and how to get help.</p>
						<h4>What people groups are your main audience?</h4>
						<p>For organizing educational events, churches and schools. For individuals, students in middle school through college.</p>
						<h4> Have you expierenced any pushback from the audiences you are trying to reach such as schools, healthcare systems, or law enforcement?</h4>
						<p> No, we have not. It is surprising to a lot of people that law enforcement needs education on human trafficking, but they are the first to say they are not experts on the matter. We help them understand signs of human trafficking and how to help victims.</p>

					<h5> What is your experience with One Child at a Time?</h5>
					<p> I have known Glenda Skipper since I was a teenager. She was and is very passionate about the cause of One Child at a Time which led to her sharing volunteering opportunities with myself and others at our church and youth group. She always kept us up to date on human trafficking defense and awareness.</p>
						<h5>Do you think the current One Child at a Time website has a clear path of where users can go to inquire about volunteering? Is this necessary for the website?</h5>
					<p>
						No, I found it difficult to see where I how I can volunteer. A more clear solution is needed so that One Child at a Time can easily gain access to enthusiastic volunteers.
					</p>
					<h5> What is the most prevelant type content needed on the website and why?</h5>
					<p>
						Educational resources should be the priority of the website. Not just to have lots of information on human trafficking, but presented in a way that is easy to understand and follow. One Child at a Time believes that education is the strongest weapon against human trafficking so learning resources should be effectively presented to the viewer.
