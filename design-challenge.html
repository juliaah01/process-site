						<h1>Design Challenge</h1>
						<p class="info">What exacty is the challenge we are facing in the design of One Child at a Time?</p>
						<br>
					</header>
					<h4>What is the problem youâ€™re trying to solve?</h4>
						<p>End human trafficking by helping individuals through education, rescuing trafficking victims, and restoring human dignity through affirmation.
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
						<H4>The Design Question</H4>
						<p>How can the online presence of One Child at a Time be improved so that the organization can be more effective in their pursuit to end human trafficking?
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
						<h4>Ultimate Impact</h4>
						<p>Help victims of human trafficking individually by personally intervening. Also, make others aware of the severity of human trafficking and educate them on how to help.
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
						<h4>Possible Solutions</h4>
						<p>Creating a more cohesive and clean brand identity so that viewers will recognize One Child at a Time easily across different platforms as well as reorganizing their website so that the most important information is seen first and other information is well organized and categorized.
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
						<h4>Context and Constraints</h4>
						<p>The sheer amount of information is daunting when considering how to organize all of it within different pages or categories. It will take a lot of deliberation to establish a hierarchy within the website. All of the information is really important, so this step will take lots of time and consideration so as to not make any information unnoticed by the viewers.
						<br>
						<br>
					</p>
						<h4>The Design Question (restated)</h4>
						<p>What is the brand identity and online presence of One Child at a Time lacking which is causing viewers not to reach the information they need in a timely and effective manner?
