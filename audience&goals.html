						alt="sticky notes of directly involved people groups" /></span>One important step in facing this
				design challenge for "One Child at a Time" was to focus on who I am trying to reach and why. I grouped
				together different people groups into who would be the most directly impacted and this image shows the
				final list of those directly involved. I also seperated those that needed help and those who could
				provide help. Children, women, highschool students, and college students were the directly impacted
				groups in need of help and healthcare workers, past human trafficking victims, and churches are the
				directly impacted groups that could provide help.
