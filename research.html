						<p class="info">The importance of One Child At A Time and how they can be more effective</p>
					</header>
					<p>“One Child At A Time is a 501(c)3 non-profit human trafficking awareness organization.  Our mission is to eliminate modern slavery one person at a time. We work to prevent human trafficking through education, rescue trafficked individuals through intervention, and restore human dignity through affirmation.”
						<br>
						<br>
						One Child At A Time has worked to educate churches, schools, first responders and other communities of South Carolina and beyond. Glenda Skipper, CEO and founder of One Child At A Time, brings awareness of the severity of human trafficking as well as what we can do to help. The organization has also partnered with Rays of HOPE, a ministry in India working to rescue and rehabilitate victims of human trafficking. 
						<br>
						<br>
						While there is lots of useful information on their website, it could be organized in a more efficient way. I think the organization needs to focus on the hierarchy of information on their website to reorder in a way that is most effective for both victims and potential partners. There is also some outdated information, the most recent annual report shown on the website is from 2020. Their social media presence is also lacking cleanliness and organization.
						<br>
						<br>
						The overall branding of One Child At A Time could also be improved. Choosing a bright and limited color palette would help to make them more recognizable and modern. With better recognizability, potential users will be more likely to remember and consider visiting their website.
