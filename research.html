				<p class="info">The importance of One Child at a Time and how they can be more effective</p>
			</header>
			<p>“One Child at a Time is a 501(c)3 non-profit human trafficking awareness organization. Our mission is to
				eliminate modern slavery one person at a time. We work to prevent human trafficking through education,
				rescue trafficked individuals through intervention, and restore human dignity through affirmation.”
				<br>
				<br>
				One Child at a Time has worked to educate churches, schools, first responders and other communities of
				South Carolina and beyond. Glenda Skipper, CEO and founder of One Child at a Time, brings awareness of
				the severity of human trafficking as well as what we can do to help. The organization has also partnered
				with Rays of HOPE, a ministry in India working to rescue and rehabilitate victims of human trafficking.
				<br>
				<br>
				While there is lots of useful information on their website, it could be organized in a more efficient
				way. I think the organization needs to focus on the hierarchy of information on their website to reorder
				in a way that is most effective for both victims and potential partners. There is also some outdated
				information, the most recent annual report shown on the website is from 2020. Their social media
				presence is also lacking cleanliness and organization.
				<br>
				<br>
				The overall branding of One Child at a Time could also be improved. Choosing a bright and limited color
				palette would help to make them more recognizable and modern. With better recognizability, potential
				users will be more likely to remember and consider visiting their website.

				<p>Getting more specific on who One Child at a Time is and how they can grow</p>
			</header>

			<h4>Explore the most recent news in your client's field. Use the Internet, newspapers, magazines, or
				journals to know what’s new. This can be news stories of interest, relevant scientific research,
				or anything that could help you in finding a solution to the design challenge.</h4>
			<br>

				<img src="images/newsstoryss.png" alt="SC Now story on One Child at a Time">
			</div>
			In October of last year, One Child at a Time partnered with Florence School District 1 and helped
			spot 10 potential human trafficking victims. Glenda Skipper, founder of One Child at a Time, wrote a
			curriculum for the schools’ eighth grade health lab. She also trained the teachers which then taught
			over 500 students. The students received a form to fill out in this course and one of the questions
			asked if they were being threatened by a predator to which 10 students said yes. Skipper and the
			rest of the team at One Child at a Time were then able to help these students first hand.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Try to find recent innovations in your client's particular area. They could be technological,
				behavioral, or cultural. </h4>
			<br>
			<p>
			The most effective way to combat human trafficking as a society is to be informed, therefore One
			Child at a Time is exploring new groups and methods of education. By becoming informed on human
			trafficking, one is able to better spot people who could be victims or traffickers, help survivors
			more effectively, and guard themselves or others against human trafficking. One Child at a time puts
			lots of effort behind speaking with schools, law enforcement, churches, and more.</p>
			<br>
			<div class="image fit">
				<img src="images/guardianstatss.png" alt="Guardian Group statistics">
			</div>
			<p>
			Guardian Group stated in their 2021 Human Trafficking Report that a large amount of human
			trafficking takes place or begins on social media or online in some way. This is a great reason for
			One Child at a Time to continue to be active on social media and improve their online presence.</p>
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Take a look at other solutions in your area. Which ones worked? Which ones didn’t? Are there any
				that feel similar to what you might design? Any solutions that have inspired you to make one of
				your own? </h4>
			<br>
			In the first point, the education of Florence’s School District 1 by Glenda Skipper was discussed as
			a recent accomplishment by One Child at a Time. Younger generations becoming informed on human
			trafficking is hugely successful because they are often the most at risk of trafficking or they are
			around those who could be most at risk.
			<br>
			One Child at a Time is making incredible progress by going out and speaking to groups in person. The
			need for change is with their overall online presence. My design help would create a more cohesive
			and recognizable brand identity for One Child at a Time. This identity would cover their website,
			social platforms, advertisements and any kind of stationery or merchandise. Creating a more fluid
			and organized website will also draw more users in and allow the information to be more accessible
			to those in need.
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Is there any market data that you can dig up that may be relevant in helping you solve the
				design challenge?</h4>
			<br>
			According to the 2021 Human Trafficking Report from the Guardian Group, child sex trafficking was
			reported in every state, roughly 150,000 escort ads were posted online everyday, and 44% of victims
			report no one reached out to offer them help while they were in need.
			<br>
			While these statistics are very upsetting, they point to the issue of education, specifically
			online. Online human trafficking awarenesss needs to be spread thoroughly nationwide. One Child at a
			Time is fighting to make this issue known and it is so important according to these statistics that
			their online appearance and accessibility is easy to ingest and navigate.
